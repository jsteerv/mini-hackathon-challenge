# Idea: "Iterate Like A Pro" - Meta Landing Page

## The Concept

A meta landing page that showcases **how we build beautiful frontends with AI coding agents**, using that exact workflow to create it. The page itself is proof of the process.

## Title & Tagline

**Title:** "Iterate Like A Pro"

**Tagline:** "How I Built This Page With AI (While Building It With AI)"

## Visual Theme

**Style:** Cyberpunk / Neon
**Color Palette:** Cyber Orange (Sunset)
- Primary: Neon Orange (#ff6b35)
- Secondary: Teal (#00d9c0)
- Background: Deep Slate (#0a0e27)
- Accents: Warm gradient transitions

**Vibe:** Tech-forward, glowing accents, matrix-style aesthetics with warm sunset tones

## Hero Section (Hybrid Approach)

**Components:**
1. **Meta Visual** - Landing page shown in terminal/code editor aesthetic, being built in real-time
2. **Strong Statement** - Bold headline about AI collaboration with neon glow effects
3. **Process Hint** - Subtle preview of the PIV+PRP workflow visualization

**Copy:**
```
ITERATE LIKE A PRO
How I Built This Page With AI (While Building It With AI)

Discover the PIV × PRP workflow that ships production-ready code on the first pass.
```

## Core Sections

### 1. The Workflow: PIV × PRP

**Content:**
- Visual explanation of PIV Loop (Prompt-Iterate-Validate)
- PRP methodology breakdown (Product Requirement Prompt)
- How they combine for first-pass success
- Interactive flowchart/animated diagram

**Visual:**
- Animated process diagram showing the cycle
- Glowing nodes connected by animated lines
- Scroll-driven reveal of each stage

### 2. Prompt Patterns Deep-Dive

**Content:**
- Exact prompt patterns that work
- Why they work (the psychology/syntax)
- Examples from this actual project
- Before/after prompt comparisons

**Visual:**
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting (neon theme)
- Hover effects reveal "why this works"
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

### 3. Pro Tips & Gotchas

**Content:**
- Context is King: How to provide the right references
- Validation Loops: Executable tests/lints
- Information Density: Keywords and patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

**Visual:**
- Card-based layout with flip animations
- Warning/callout boxes with neon borders
- "Gotcha" alerts with glitch effect

## Technical Implementation

**Tech Stack:**
- React + Vite (base requirement)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for scroll animations (unless CSS-only is faster)
- React Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered effects

**Performance Considerations:**
- Minimal JS for animations (prefer CSS when possible)
- Lazy load components
- Optimized images/assets
- Smooth scroll behavior

**Interactive Elements:**
- Scroll-triggered fade-ins
- Parallax effects on hero
- Hover states on cards
- Glitch text effects on headings
- Animated gradient borders

## The Meta Story

This landing page will reference its own creation process:
- "This section was built using the PIV loop"
- "The gradient you see? That was iteration 3"
- "I used PRP methodology to spec the animations"

Real examples from our development session will be embedded throughout.

## Bonus Features (Time Permitting)

- [ ] Terminal typing effect in hero
- [ ] Color theme toggle (Orange/Cyan/Purple variants)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive hamburger menu
- [ ] Smooth scroll navigation
- [ ] "How this was built" expandable sections

## Deployment Plan

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Netlify or Render (free tier)
3. Test responsive breakpoints
4. Validate animations on mobile
5. Submit URL when complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Visually impressive (distinctive cyberpunk/orange aesthetic)
- [ ] 3+ sections explaining workflow
- [ ] Deployed with shareable URL
- [ ] Specific, actionable insights (not generic)
- [ ] Interactive process diagram
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Shows actual prompts and examples
