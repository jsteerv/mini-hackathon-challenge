### Conversation Summary

#### Interactive Q&A Session

**Question 1: AI Coding Workflow**
- **Answer:** PIV Loop (Prompt-Iterate-Validate) + PRP framework
- **Note:** PRP = Product Requirement Prompt from https://github.com/Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng

**Question 2: Visual Theme**
- **Answer:** Cyberpunk / Neon

**Question 3: Hero Insight**
- **Answer:** Iterative Refinement (the secret sauce)

**Question 4: PRP Framework Understanding**
- **Research:** Read PRP repo - it's PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook
- **Key insight:** "Minimum viable packet an AI needs to plausibly ship production-ready code on the first pass"
- **Three layers:** Context (files, docs, snippets), Implementation Blueprint, Validation Loop

**Question 5: Sections to Include**
- Prompt Patterns Deep-dive
- Interactive Process Diagram
- Pro Tips & Gotchas

**Question 6: Interactive Elements**
- **Answer:** Subtle scroll-driven effects

**Question 7: Hero Section Approach**
- **Answer:** Hybrid Approach (meta visual + strong statement + process hint)

**Question 8: Color Palette**
- **Answer:** Cyber Orange (Sunset) - Orange + teal accents with deep slate backgrounds

**Question 9: Tech Stack**
- **Answer:** The fastest way that looks cool (React + Vite base, likely Tailwind + Framer Motion)

**Question 10: Project Title**
- **Answer:** "Iterate Like A Pro"

### Final Concept

**Title:** "Iterate Like A Pro"
**Tagline:** "How I Built This Page With AI (While Building It With AI)"

**Visual Identity:**
- Cyberpunk/Neon aesthetic
- Cyber Orange (Sunset) color scheme
- Meta visual showing page being built in real-time

**Core Sections:**
1. The Workflow: PIV × PRP (with interactive diagram)
2. Prompt Patterns Deep-Dive (with real examples)
3. Pro Tips & Gotchas (card-based layout)

**Tech Stack:** React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion (or CSS-only for speed)

### Decisions Made

- ✅ Hybrid hero approach for maximum impact
- ✅ Scroll-driven animations for interactivity
- ✅ Orange/teal color scheme for distinctive look
- ✅ Real prompts and examples from this project
- ✅ Process diagram as visual centerpiece
