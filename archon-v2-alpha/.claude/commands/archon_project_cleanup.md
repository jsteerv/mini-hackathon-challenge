# Clean Up Archon Project

## Project: $ARGUMENTS

Use agent-organizer to review and clean up project: $ARGUMENTS

The agent-organizer will:
1. Review the current state of the Archon project
2. Identify tasks stuck in "doing" status without recent updates
3. Find abandoned or incomplete work
4. Move tasks back to appropriate status
5. Generate a project health report

The cleanup process includes:
- Reviewing all task statuses and assignments
- Identifying blockers or issues preventing completion
- Reorganizing tasks based on current priorities
- Updating project documentation
- Ensuring all completed work is properly documented

The agent-organizer will use archon-project-orchestrator to:
- Query project and task status
- Update task assignments and status
- Archive completed work
- Generate recommendations for project health

This helps maintain clean project state and ensures work doesn't get lost or forgotten.
